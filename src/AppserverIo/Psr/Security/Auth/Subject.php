/**
 * A subject represents a grouping of related information for a single entity, such
 * as a person. Such information includes the subject's identities as well as its
 * security-related attributes (passwords and cryptographic keys, for example).
 *
 * Subjects may potentially have multiple identities. Each identity is represented
 * as a principal within the subject. Principals simply bind names to a subject.
 * For example, a subject that happens to be a person, Alice, might have
 * two principals: one which binds "Alice Bar", the name on her driver license,
 * to the subject, and another which binds, "999-99-9999", the number on her student
 * identification card, to the subject. Both principals refer to the same subject
 * even though each has a different name.
 *
 * A subject may also own security-related attributes, which are referred to as
 * credentials. Sensitive credentials that require special protection, such as
 * private cryptographic keys, are stored within the private credentials.
 * Credentials intended to be shared, such as public key certificates or Kerberos
 * server tickets are stored within the public credentials. Different permissions
 * are required to access and modify the different credential maps.
 *
 * To retrieve all the principals associated with a subject, invoke the
 * getPrincipals() method. To retrieve invoke the getPublicCredentials() method or
 * getPrivateCredentials() method, respectively. To modify the returned map of
 * principals and credentials, use the methods defined in the map class. For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 *      $subject = new Subject();
 *      $principal = new Principal();
 *      $credential = new String();
 *
 *      // add a principal and credential to the subject
 *      $subject->getPrincipals()->add($principal);
 *      $subject->getPublicCredentials()->add($credential);
 * </pre>
 *
 * This subject class implements the Serializable interface. While the principals
 * associated with the subject are serialized, the credentials associated with the
 * subject are not.
